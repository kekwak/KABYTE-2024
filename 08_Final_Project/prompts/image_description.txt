Scene:
<SCENE>

Context: <CONTEXT>

REMEMBER:
1) YOU HAVE ONLY ONE IMAGE!
2) Also each word does not mean a separate subject.
3) Context is related to Scene image.
4) Objects in Scene wich are close to each other are THE ONE OBJECT.
5) The Scene is very often wrong, so use context as the main Context.
